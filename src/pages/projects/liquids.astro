      Since the beginning, we’ve dreamed of reaching the Karmen line, but it takes a lot of work to get there. Our work in both the NASA Student Launch and Spaceport America Cup projects has helped to prepare the foundation; now it’s time to reach new heights. The liquids project works to develop student-designed engines while providing fostering students’ skills with hands-on experiences.

      The liquids project has successfully test-fired a commercial LR-101 rocket engine, and work is now focused on developing their additively-manufactured Serenity engine.
