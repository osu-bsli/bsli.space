      BSLI NASA Student Launch Initiative (SLI) project team commits to an eight-month process of designing, building, and flying payloads or vehicle components to support NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) program. Each year, a new payload challenge is released by NASA, and the team works to design a vehicle and payload system to meet those needs in addition to writing competitive proposals and participating in design reviews.
