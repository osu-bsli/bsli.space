      BSLI Spaceport America Cup (SAC) project team is focused on designing, manufacturing, and launching a student-built rocket. Every year, the team travels to New Mexico to compete in the Spaceport America Cup, the largest intercollegiate rocketry competition. The team competes in the 30k, Student Research and Designed (SRAD) category, meaning they design all components of a rocket to reach or get as close to 30,000 feet as possible.
